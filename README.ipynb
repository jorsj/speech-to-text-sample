    "* **Google Cloud Project:** You must have an active Google Cloud Project with the Speech-to-Text API enabled. Replace \"sandcastle-401718\" with your actual project ID.\n",
    "* **Credentials:** The code assumes you have set up authentication for your Google Cloud project. This usually means either:\n",
    "    * Using Application Default Credentials (ADC) by running this code in an environment where credentials are automatically found (like Google Cloud Compute Engine)\n",
    "    * Setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your service account key file.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Storage Bucket:**  Create a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket within your project and ensure the input audio file (`6538427.flac` in this example) is uploaded to it.  \n",
    "* **Python Libraries:**  Use `pip install` to get the following:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install google-cloud-speech google-api-core\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "**Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code performs asynchronous speech-to-text transcription using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. Here's a breakdown of its actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connects to the Speech-to-Text API:**  Creates a client object for interacting with the API, optionally customizing the endpoint if you're in a different region than 'us-central1'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defines Project ID and File Locations:** Specifies your Google Cloud project ID and the locations of your input audio file (in GCS) and desired output transcript location (also in GCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configures Recognition:** Sets up the recognition process with these options:\n",
    "    * **Automatic Encoding Detection:**  The API will figure out the audio file's encoding.\n",
    "    * **`chirp_telephony` Model:** A model tailored for telephone audio quality.\n",
    "    * **Language:** Spanish (US)\n",
    "    * **No word timestamps:** Simplifies output.\n",
    "    * **Single channel transcription:** Only transcribes the first audio channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specifies Output Location:**  Instructs the API to save the transcript in the provided GCS bucket. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prepares Input Metadata:**  Provides information about the input audio file's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Constructs Recognition Request:** Bundles all the configuration and file information into a formal request for the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Initiates Asynchronous Transcription:** Sends the request, starting a background transcription process. To get the final results, you'll need to wait for the operation to complete and then access `operation.result()`."
